# ADGICC
Auto-Differentiable Geometry Investigation Corona Code

# Description
ADGICC is a code built to generate Comptonised emission spectra and probe
different potential geometries and conditions. It is written in Julia with
the aim to have full auto-differentiability in the long term. This code was
developed to generate data for a Comptonisation Neural Network emulator that
approximates the photon law index dependence on angle of the illuminating
spectrum from a black hole.

#Developers
Currently, two people work on this code as a side project so development is 
very slow. Any contributions are very welcome.
